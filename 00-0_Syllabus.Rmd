## Course Description

The purpose of this course is to provide graduate students with the critical computing skills necessary to conduct research in quantitative/computational social science. This course is not an introduction to statistics, computer science, or specialized social science methods. Rather, the focus will be on practical skills necessary to be successful in further methods work. The first portion of the class introduces students to basic computer literacy, terminologies, and the R programming language. The second part of the course provides students the opportunity to use the skills they learned in part 1 towards practical applications such as webscraping, data collection through APIs, automated text analysis, etc. We will assume no prior experience with programming or computer science.

#### Objectives {-}

By the end of the course, students should be able to

* Understand basic programming terminologies, structures, and conventions.
* Write, execute, and debug R code.
* Produce reproducible analyses using R Markdown.
* Clean, transform, and wrangle data using the `tidyverse` packages.
* Scrape data from websites and APIs.
* Parse and analyze text documents.
* Be familiar with the concepts and tools of a variety of computational social science applications.
* Master basic Git and GitHub workflows.
* Learn independently and train themselves in a variety of computational applications and tasks through online documentation.

## Who Should Take This Course

This course is designed for Political Science Graduate students, but any graduate student is welcome. We will not presume any prior programming or computer science experience.

## Requirements and Evaluation

#### Final Grades {-}

This is a graded class based on the following:

* Completion of assigned homework (50%).
* Participation (25%).
* Final project (25%).

#### Assignments {-}

Assignments will be assigned at the end of every Thursday session. They will be due one week later, unless otherwise noted. The assignments are intended to expand upon the lecture material and to help students develop the actual skills that will be useful for applied work. The assignments will be frequent, but each of them should be fairly short.

You are encouraged to work in groups, but the work you turn in must be your own. It is not acceptable to submit homework as a group or to turn in copies of the same code or output. While you are encouraged to use the internet to help you debug, do not copy and paste large chunks of code that you do not understand. Remember, the only way you actually learn how to write code is by writing code!

Portions of the homework in `R` should be completed using [R Markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/), a markup language for producing well-formatted documents with embedded R code and outputs. To submit your homework, knit the R Markdown file to PDF and then submit the PDF file through Canvas (unless otherwise noted).

#### Class Participation {-}

The class participation portion of the grade can be satisfied in one or more of the following ways:

* Attending the lectures.
* Asking and answering questions in class.
* Attending office hours.
* Contributing to class discussion through the Canvas/Piazza site.
* Collaborating with the computing community by attending a workshop or meetup, submitting a pull request to a GitHub repository (including the class repository), answering a question on StackExchange, or other involvement in the social computing/digital humanities community. 

#### Final Project {-}

Students have two options for class projects:

1. __Data project__: Use the tools we learned in class on your own data of interest. Collect and/or clean the data, perform some analysis, and visualize the results. Post your reproducible code on GitHub.

2. __Tool project__: Create a tutorial on a tool we did not cover in class. Ideas include: Bash, LaTeX, pandoc, quanteda, tidytext, etc. Post it on GitHub.

Students are required to write a short proposal by __November 5__ (no more than 2 paragraphs) in order to get approval/feedback from the instructors. 

Project materials (i.e., a GitHub repository) will be due by end of day on __December 7__. We will specify submission details in class.

On __December 8__, we will have a **lightning talk session** where students can present their projects in a maximum 5-minute talk.

#### Late Policy and Incompletes {-}
All deadlines are strict. Late assignments will be dropped a full letter grade for each 24 hours past the deadline. Exceptions will be made for students with a documented emergency or illness.

I will only consider granting incompletes to students under extreme personal/family duress.

#### Academic Integrity {-}
I follow a zero-tolerance policy on all forms of academic dishonesty. All students are responsible for familiarizing themselves with, and following, university policies regarding proper student conduct. Being found guilty of academic dishonesty is a serious offense and may result in a failing grade for the assignment in question and, possibly, for the entire course.

## Activities and Materials

#### Course Structure {-}

Classes will follow a "workshop" style, combining lecture, demonstration, and coding exercises. We envision the class to be as interactive/hands-on as possible, with students programming every session. __You must bring a laptop to class.__ 

It is important that students __complete the requisite reading__ before class. I anticipate spending 1/2 the class lecturing and 1/2 practicing with code challenges. 

#### Course Website {-}

All course notes will be posted on https://plsc-31101.github.io/course/, including class notes, code demonstrations, sample data, and assignments. Students will be assigned reading from these notes before every class.

Students are encouraged to submit pull requests to the course repository (https://github.com/plsc-31101/course), for example if they find a typo or a particularly helpful resource that would aid other students. 

Students projects will also be shared on the course website. 

#### Canvas {-}

We will use Canvas for communication (announcements and questions) and turning in assignments. 

You should ask questions about class material and assignments through the Canvas/Piazza website so that everyone can benefit from the discussion. We encourage you to respond to each other’s questions as well. Questions of a personal nature can be emailed to us directly.

#### Computer Requirements and Software {-}

By the end of the first week, you should install the following software on your computer:

* Access to the UNIX command line (e.g., a Mac laptop, a Bash wrapper on Windows).
* Git.
* R and RStudio (latest versions).

This requires a computer that can handle all this software. Almost any Mac will do the job. Most Windows machines are fine too if they have enough space and memory.

See [Install Page](installation) for more information. We will be having an __InstallFest on Wednesday, September 30 from 9:30 to 11:30 am, on Zoom__ for those students experiencing difficulties downloading and installing the requisite software.
